## Features
The power supply is designed to operate within an input voltage range of 12-16V and provide an
adjustable output voltage range of 4-10V. The design incorporates three transistors,
one zener diode, and four resistors to regulate and limit the voltage and current. The
line regulation ensures that the output voltage remains relatively constant even with
variations in the input voltage, while the load regulation ensures stable output
voltage despite changes in the load conditions. The current limiting feature protects
the circuit and connected devices by preventing excessive current flow. This project
describes the design methodology, circuit schematic, component selection, and
testing results to demonstrate the functionality and performance of the designed
linear power supply. The obtained results showcase satisfactory line and load
regulation, as well as effective current limiting, making the power supply suitable for
a range of electronic applications.
